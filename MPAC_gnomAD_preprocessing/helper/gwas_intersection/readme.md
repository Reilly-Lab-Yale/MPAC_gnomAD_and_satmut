steve's request
- intersect gnomad with
- everything in [GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/)
  - GWAS cata *should* be a strict subset (make sure)
- modify column names to accurately reflect pos & chr belonging to lead SNP 
- cCREs intersect
- Summarize : "X number of variants w/ emvar call in cCRE"
     - Alluvial plot
**no filters**

from steve's files
